# Odin Recipes

#

# This is a website of recipes collected from allrecipes.com.

# I created it using HTML only (so far).

# In the future, I would like to style it with CSS and make it responsive.

# As the project title implies, this website is an assignment I did while studying with The Odin Project (link to assignment below).
